2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.

## Data Analysis

3 pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between sales and other factors such as product category, store location, product type.
